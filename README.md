## CSGHub

CSGHub is an open-source platform designed for managing Large Language Models (LLM) assets, offering an efficient way to handle the entire LLM and their assets such as datasets, spaces and codes etc. It allows users to upload, download, store, verify, and distribute LLM assets like DeepSeek,Llama etc.via a web interface, `git` command line, a natural language Chatbot, or [CSGHub SDK](https://github.com/OpenCSGs/csghub-sdk).

Additionally, CSGHub features microservice submodules and standardized OpenAPIs for seamless integration with existing systems. It aims to provide a user-friendly management platform specifically for LLM, which can be deployed On-Premise for secure, offline operation. Essentially, CSGHub serves as a private, on-premise version of Huggingface.
